    <h2>About Sergio</h2>
    <p>
      SÃ©rgio Vieira de Mello was a Brazilian United Nations diplomat who worked
      on several UN humanitarian and political programs for over 34 years.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      In May 2003 Vieira de Mello was appointed as the Special Representative of
      the UN Secretary General to Iraq, an appointment initially intended to
      last for four months. According to The New York Times Magazine journalist
      James Traub in his book The Best Intentions, Vieira de Mello turned down
      the appointment three times before Kofi Annan was pressured by US
      President George W. Bush and Condoleezza Rice. According to Samantha Power
      in her book Sergio: One Man's Fight to Save the World, Vieira de Mello met
      Bush at a meeting in March 2003, at which the two men discussed the human
      rights situation in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, a controversial
      issue for the United States. In June 2003, Vieira de Mello was part of a
      team responsible for inspecting Abu Ghraib prison before it was rebuilt.

      He was killed in the Canal Hotel bombing in Iraq along with 20 other
      members of his staff on 19 August 2003 while working as UN High
      Commissioner for Human Rights and United Nations Special Representative
      for Iraq. Before his death, he was considered a likely candidate for UN
      Secretary-General.
